            <p id="p1">Idly and Dosa form a major part of regular breakfast in South India. However these are cooked only after grinding the rice with greater portion of water to make it a liquid, in which further it is changed to a solid shape after cooking or steaming. This is the only variety of rice which shows better results for the preparation of liquid ground rice with water which is often called as Maavu in Tamil. When this rice is added with water the rice looses its rigidity and becomes soft enough for grinding. Further the aroma and the taste are better in this variety of rice when compared to any other kind of rice. The Paddy Used for this Rice is ADT37. <br><br>
